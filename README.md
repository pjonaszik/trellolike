<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a Trello like app.

Trello is a Task and Project management with cards or boards.

A board is like a workspace, with card inside.

Card represents most of the time projects stages according to organizations
* Backlog,
* New,
* Accepted,
* In Progress,
* Locked
* Testing
* Closed

Or ... (following for example a Git flow pattern):
* master (main branch)
* hotfix
* release (tag)
* dev (development)
* feature (feature based on dev branch)
* ...

## Main goal
1. This app allows users to manage tasks and project. With what has been said above, we can also say that one board represents one project and contains one or more lists. 
2. Just drag-n-drop to change the order of lists, the order of tasks inside the list, and also move task from one list to another as well.

## Application Features

Allow user to,
- create a new list
- edit list name
- delete list
- rearrange the lists in the board using drag and drop

- create new tasks
- edit task 
- delete task
- rearrange the tasks in the list by drag and drop
